# TargetFrameBuff
TargetFrameBuff allows you to view up to 16 buffs & debuffs on a target in the default UI.

**Layout:**
- **Buffs**: 16 buffs displayed above the target frame (5 in first row, 11 in second row)
- **Debuffs**: 16 debuffs displayed below the target frame in 4-4-8 layout (no gap)

Supports 1.12.1, but will most likely work on any vanilla patch.

### Known issues

- Sometimes debuffs show up with the wrong category,
for example a magic debuff will show up as physical.
